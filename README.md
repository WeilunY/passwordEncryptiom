# 65Team-EncryptionTool
GOAL:
The goal of our project is to create  a password encryption tool to help users transform their “easy-to-remember” password into a  “hard-to-break” password.

Description:
The idea of this password encryption tool is to add an additional layer of security to pre-existing password maintenance software by removing the knowledge of the actual password from the program.
The tool will use a random encryption scheme (key) to encrypt a simple password given a password and an account/website,  and will locally  store the key and the account/website that it was associated with.
This way, a user can only retrieve their password by entering their original password and the website into their local instance of the tool.

Inspiration:
The project was inspired by our introduction to encryption in PA1, as well as the omnipresent frustration of the security conscious with retrieving and storing complex passwords, all while still having to remember a secure password to lock up their stored encrypted passwords.
The realization that many people still avoid using this imperfect software in favor of using an insecure master password indicated to us that the market for a more convenient and secure method of password management is still open.
